- git add filename  # add file into staging area
- git add . #  added all files in the present location  to the staging area in
- git status #To know the status of the files(worksapace)
- git commit -m "commit message"  # commit the code to local repo
- git push origin main # push the code to remote repo
- git branch  --> list the branches in the repo
- git checkout branchname  --> switch form one branch to other branch
- git branch branchname --> create branch
- git branch -d branchaname ---Delete the branch
- git branch -D  branchname ---delete the branch forcfully
- git chekout -b branchname  -> creare the brancha and switch to that branch as well
- git checkout  filename  --> to discard the changes to the particular file
