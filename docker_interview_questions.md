 e) we are  ne need to allocate any resources like RAM and CPU  to the containerisation

## 3) what is difference between virtualiation and containerisation
virtualiation:
a) we can install the vm ware software (hyperveser) on the physical machine
b) create the mutiple machine with required os ,RAM and CPU

containerisation:
a)we can include application code, os and other software liabries as docker image
b)run the docker iamges as contianer to host the application

## 4) what is dokcer file?
a)Docekr file is used to  build docker image
b) Docker file  is place where we  can pass instructions to buiild the docker image.

## 5) what is docker image?
docker is read only template whcih contains all softewares liabries
 or

docker is read only template which contains all instructions to build the docker contianer

```
## 7) how to run the docker contianer?
```
docker run -d <imaagename> 
```

## 8) how to login into container?

## what is difference between docker stop and docker pause?
- The main difference between the paused and stopped states is that the memory portion of the state is

- when a container is stopped, whereas, in the paused state, its memory portion stays intact.
## 17) what is purpose RUN instruction?
- RUN instruction is used to execute any command and install any software in the contianer
## 18) what is the  purpose of  COPY instruction?
- COPY instruction is used to copy the file from docker host to docker container

- 2)ADD instruction  is used to copy the file from internet  to docker container

## 20) what is the purpose EXPOSE intruction?

- EXPOSE instruction is used to expose the application port

## 21) what is difference between CMD and ENTEYPOINT

- 2)ENTRYPOINT command and parameters will not be overwritten from command line. 
- Instead, all command line arguments will be added after ENTRYPOINT parameters

RUN yum -y install httpd
COPY index.html /var/www/html/
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/httpd","-D","FOREGROUND"]
```

## 23) To pull the image from dokcer repositary

```

## 24) To attach running container
```
# docker attach containeid
```

## 25) how to remove the Docker image
```
docker rmi imagename

## 26) To know the docker information
```
docker info

```

## 27) Expose your application to host server
```sh
docker run -d  -p <host_port>:<container_port> --name <container_Name> <image_name>:<Image_version/tag>

docker run -d --name httpd_server -p 8080:80 httpd:2.2
